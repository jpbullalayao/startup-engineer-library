# Start-up Engineer Library

Welcome to the Start-up Engineer Library!

This repository is a compilation of the highest quality engineering, start-up, and product resources that I have found during my career as an engineer building start-ups. The goal of this library is to share knowledge that you might find invaluable as you grow in your career as a software engineer working in start-ups - whether your goal is to grow and succeed in your current role or build your own start-up someday.

This content of this library is primarily focused on tactical insight and advice from start-up founders, engineers, and product managers that will enable you to reflect and take action towards your individual goals.

If you enjoy the content in this library, please star, watch, and share the repo with someone else who might also enjoy and find it useful. I will continue to vet and add more resources regularly.
